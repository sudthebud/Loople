## Known Issues
- Most known issues relate to button spam
    - Spamming the shortcuts for word history can cause the turn number to appear even if the turn history itself is gone
    - Spamming the mouse to click a letter as the loop is being submitted can cause it to get stuck *(unsure if fixed)*
    - Spamming the arrow keys to move between letters as the loop is being submitted can cause the submission process to mess up *(unsure if fixed)*
